### Overview

Ring UI Library is a collection of common web components being developed as a basis for current and future web UIs for
JetBrains' products. This library is very much work-in-progress.

We are using some elements of the [BEM methodology](http://bem.info/) to write HTML/CSS.

UI Library is being developed by the members of the [Hub](https://jetpeople.jetbrains.com/team/2-111/Server) team.

Builds are available on [buildserver](http://buildserver/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Ring_UILibrary).
