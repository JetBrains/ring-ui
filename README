Ring UI: development environment setup

1. Install node.js

2. Install gulp:

    npm install -g gulp

3. Install dependencies:

    npm install

4. Start the devserver:

        gulp

    or

        gulp build-dev

    (the latter one makes development build and starts watcher on all project source files to rebuild on changes, while the former runs webpack dev server)
